# Sudoers rules for DVD Ripper Web Dashboard
# Allows dvd-web user to kill DVD ripper processes for cancel functionality
#
# Installation: /etc/sudoers.d/dvd-web
#
# This is needed because the dashboard runs as dvd-web but pipeline
# processes run as dvd-rip, dvd-encode, and dvd-transfer users.

# Allow dvd-web to kill processes (for cancel functionality)
dvd-web ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/kill
